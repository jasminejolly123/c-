# Week 7 Lab G
## Using Parasoft
![lab g not allowing rules](https://github.com/jasminejolly123/c-/assets/114992186/8800c960-b6d6-42eb-94fe-7877f1df0df4)

I had a problem with installing parasoft at home some i used the university computers but still ran into issues.
Here you can see the rules file and the test configurations for parasoft but I could not import the rules file into the test configurations.


![lab g 1](https://github.com/jasminejolly123/c-/assets/114992186/7908bc46-00e3-4006-8a84-de60f0672e15)

As I could not use the proper rules I used the recommended rules.


![lab g 2](https://github.com/jasminejolly123/c-/assets/114992186/d0414aa0-39a2-4732-b504-b961da27ac40)

Here is the errors with severity shown with the recommended rules with the cdode unchanged.


![lab g no errors](https://github.com/jasminejolly123/c-/assets/114992186/8a7cdbd6-df19-4293-8fc5-12c0f1965226)

After making changes to the code i ran the recommended rules again and had no errors.
